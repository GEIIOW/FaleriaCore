			<p class="flavor">“The preparation for the work that calls to me has led me to every corner of factual mortal knowledge, from medicine and astronomy, to ecology and zoology but it was mythology that has given me my first thread to sow. Deep within Master Salvgar’s Penury is a quick transcript detailing the creation of the heroic demons we call Derenesans. If said passage is to be believed, the souls of the residents of Derenes Dal were reshaped, reformed and placed into a new body that would defend the topmost circle of Basalos. That’s exactly where my researh needs to start: on how to move and mold souls.”</p>
			<p>- Y. Mageshell, Manyhals of Death.</p>
			<p>The Derenesan get their name from their land of origin, Derenes Dal, the topmost layer of Basalos, where the Guide takes souls deemed too good to be consumed for eternal rest. The ever dutyful derenesans were created to protect said souls from the lower layers’ attacks. Empowered by their mistress’ soul, they are more resilient than most and when they set their mind to something only their own annihilation will put a stop to them.</p>

			<h4>Master Salvgar's Myth</h4>
			<p>“After a pause, from the lustful mists of Syndal emerged the numerous hordes of devils and demons who hungered for the taste of souls pure as air. The armies of Stygia were ready to be outnumbered but could never imagine the madness that radiated from their attackers eyes.[…]</p>
			<p>The battle raged on as the Demon Lady Umandália and Demon Lord Pizix watched in fright. The legions of Stygia were slowly succumbing to the weight of the other circle’s strength. With a reserved tone, Umandália decided to share her inner thoughts - Your armies are the seed of defense we desperately needed, it’s time to water them until they blossom. - she said while retreating into her own circle.[…]</p>
			<p>It was uncommon for Agógos to bring her any souls, her domain was far away from the main storages of souls down in Drejura, but the ones she did have would be more than enough for what she intended to do. She plunged her hands into the wet blue tinted clay that painted her circle’s riverside and shaped it into the form of a man. She grasped strands of the deep blue river’s flow and molded it into the statuette’s hair and then borrowed golden dust from a star and created a horn, similar to her own, on the doll. Finally, she shattered her own soul and combined a fragment of it with one of the souls that she had been protecting, infusing it into the clay statue and giving it life. The first one, who named himself Omuldie, would become her general and most trusted advisor, but he wasn’t enough. She used every soul at her disposal and, with the same level of care, gave each one life and a purpose: aid Stygia in the defense against the Penury.”</p>
			
			<h4>Children of Umandália</h4>
			<p>The Derenesans may have been infused with a mortal soul but they have no link to the life that soul had pursued. They were born to serve and protect their home, tough not all are as pure as it may appear at first. Before the end of the Penury, not all souls taken to Derenes Dal were good, unlike now, so derenesans can come in all types of personality.</p>
			<p>As a handmade people, derenesans all have differences in appearence, tough some are more noticeable than others, but all follow the basic principle of having bluish to lavender skin, deep blue hair and a single golden horn on their forehead.</p>

			<h4>Derenesan Names</h4>
			<p>Derenesans have no naming conventions they are compelled to follow and will choose their own names, some choosing to not even have one.</p>
