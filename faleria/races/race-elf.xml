			<p class="flavor">“Far greater is the admiration I harbor for the elves than for any other type of mortal in this world of ours. Only the Gods could stand in my way had I been gifted with an elven body at birth. I admit to be envious of their natural link with magic, even if some misuse it. My own dear friend, the late Emperor Talahil, showed me what his kind was capable of when he partook in a tourney some time before his tragic end. I regret having no part in the ceremonies following his death, and even more not having been able to place him back on his throne yet. Soon. If all my research bears fruit, that crown will fall back into its rightful head.”</p>
			<p>- Y. Mageshell, Manyhals of Death.</p>
			<p>The tall and slender elves were born into magic. Many are the elves that adore the finer things in life, such as silk, silver and adornments that connect them with the life around them. Due to their long life, they may come off as uncaring, stagnant or even lazy, when in reality they just see the world in a completly different way than any other mortal could hope to. They have the rare luxury of both time and patience. To an elf, twenty years are the equivalent to four human years. When the whole world is burning, why prevent it when it will be back in what seems like and instant? To others it might be years, an eternity, but for elves it’s just another decade.</p>

			<h4>Arcane Masters</h4>
			<p>It’s said that of the three primary kassian races elves were the last to emerge in Faleria, being created alongside humans and dwarves by Yivor, Myllad and Kássia as servants in their godly works. Elves were created for Myllad, God of knowledge, magic and libraries, to serve in his vast library. Through the years, elves organized and catalogued his many scrolls and tomes and sometimes even conducted field research, alongside humans. Due to these many tasks, they slowly absorved the pages’ magic into their own bodies.</p>
			
			<h4>Broken People</h4>
			<p>Elves had already settled in Faleria for many generations once the once the Great Penury broke out. The large elf population in Scanduri was heavily affected by the demonic hordes’ attacks. A local elf called Balágriel became a legendary figure during this period. Once the war ended, he rallied his fellow elves and some other allies into following him to conquer all of Faleria, starting with Zeiloryn. Frustrated by the seemingly worthless catastrophic losses they endured during the war, a huge number of elves followed him into his conquest, deeming all other elves who refused the call as traitors.</p>
			<p>So the Silvermace Empire was founded, and quickly established itself as a military power that was impossible to ignore. As they gained more territory, they proclaimed themselves as the capital of the world. Scanduri was still in ruins due to the Penury, Manyhal had not yet been united under Halwin, Nyjörsa was at it is today, a frozen tundra, and neither Raydis nor the Bysso Isles had been discovered, leaving the elven nation as the most dangerous and most powerful nation in Faleria. As some elves tried to commune with nature and others tried to rebuild homes, the ancestors of the imperial elves razed fields and enlarged their new empire.</p>

			<h4>Elf Names</h4>
			<p>Elven names are full of voiced sounds, making it difficult to find and elf with an f, s, sh, p, t, c or k in their name. Furthermore, elven names tend to involve diphthongs, l’s and r’s. Examples of elven names are Hemcriel, Zavandriel and Emaria.</p>
			
			<h4>ELF TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Elves seem to be born with an assortment of natural abilities.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em> Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Elves reach adulthood at the age of 108 but are considered young until the age of 150. On average, they live about 500 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Elves stand between 5’9 and 7 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> The ancestral elves spent many nights in dark libraries studying and researching and thus developed better vision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it was dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gold.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Keen Senses.</em></strong> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Researchers of Myllad.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Elvish Rest.</em></strong> When performing a long rest, elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they can enter a meditative state for 4 hour a day. The clear state of mind gained by completing a long rest by meditating grants you 1d10 points of temporary hit points. An elf can choose to spend the normal 8 hours of long rest sleeping, which grants them an additional free use of their subtype’s level 1 spell on.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mortal subtype.</em></strong> Four main subtypes of elf populate Faleria: Dark, Imperial, Light and Night. Choose one of these subtypes.</p>

They are often mistaken for dwarves in literature due to both being described as ice-born in silvanian, but physically they are very different. Like most elves, these are a tall and slender people, but dark elves tend to be the bulkiest elves. They have a distinct charcoal or dark blue skin, purple or pink eyes and silver white hair.</p>
