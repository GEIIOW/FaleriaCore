			<p class="flavor">“I’ve just crossed the Issa southern border into Gnawland and I was immediatly confronted by a pack of disgusting canine men known as gnolls. There was a time where we ruled these mongrels and almost managed to make distinguished and civilized people of them. I wonder if they even have a soul. Maybe Sur’Tzen’s wisdom may prove useful yet again. I did, of course, end the lives of those gnolls who threatened to hold me captive and, as I write this, I’m waiting for a second scouting party to reach my location. Let’s see what their free souls hold.”</p>
			<p>- Y. Mageshell, Manyhals of Death.</p>
			<p>Gnolls seem like chaotic, dangerous and feral creatures to those who don’t look closer into their customs and traditions. Lovers of drums and fish, their society values freedom above everything else. They do not accept a ruler who takes away their natural right to explore, fight and endanger themselves, but will abstain from their ideology temporarily when a matter that would end their life or completly rob them of freedom emerges. Despite not all gnolls believing in personal freedom to the same degree, their enemies paint them all as unruly and uncivilized.</p>

			<h4>Drylanders</h4>
			<p>Gnolls have fur that’s shades of brown or orange with dark spots throughout, a hyena like face, and appendages that are slightly longer than a humans.</p>

			<h4>Gnoll Names</h4>
			<p>Gnoll names are dragged and raspy. Many contain a lot of a’s, u’s, r’s, z’s and v’s, such as Zarun, Lassura, Razusan and Arujal.</p>

			<h4>Gnoll traits</h4>
			<p>Gnolls seem to be born with a variety of aptitudes.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength score increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Gnolls reach adulthood at around 15 and live about 60 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Most gnolls seem shorter than they are because of their hunched posture but when not hunched they thend to stand between 4’9 and 5’8 feet tall and average about 135 pounds. Your size is medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 35 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sanguine.</em></strong> Your teeth are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Relentless Striker. </em></strong> When dealing a critical hit with a melee weapon you can perform sanguine as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Blood frenzy.  </em></strong>When you roll to attack a creature that had taken damage before, and is not a construct, plant or undead, with sanguine, roll with advantage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages. </em></strong> You can speak, read and write Zaelsc and one other language of your choice.</p>
