			<p class="flavor">“My role as Gran Caster of the Silvermace Empire makes me one of the most influential men in our world. All my wishes are met, save for unlimited live subjects for my experiments. So, it was a great shock once I entered our soon to be new territory of Issadrem and found myself at the mercy of others. My prowess couldn’t be openly displayed for fear of being discovered in enemy territory, so I went from town to town looking for the kindness of strangers. I came to this land to see if their spiritual attunement would result in any difference presenting in their souls. In one of these villages I met Master Sur’Tzen, a galitarko that gave me a roof and a bowl fulll of food, along with invaluable wisdom. He told me that our soul, pure or evil, is like a cup of water. Emotions fill half the cup and logic fills the other half, but alone none quench our souls’ thirst. At that table my greatest setback was resolved. I had been looking for souls but never knew just how to locate them. I shall return to Evalnar at once.”</p>
			<p>- Y. Mageshell, Manyhals of Death.</p>
			<p>The galitarko are a people ruled by philosophy. They go through life resulute in their beliefs. Wether theirs is a philosophy of peace, evil or always choosing the lesser evil, a galitarko usually thinks twice when making a choice.</p>

			<p>The grizzly galitarko wear a resemblance to either black, brown or grey bears. Natural of Manyhal and western Zeiloryn, these huge mortals can produce a fierce roar, unlike any other. Though they might seem brutish, many carry the philosophy of Lendo, that teaches you to always try to work for the greater good. In the case of the galitarko on the western side of Zeiloryn, that meant joining the empire and it’s conquest.</p>
			<p>Grizzly galitarko often have only one name derived from an adjective given while they were young, such as Fasten, Hungrial, Madden and Swiffy.</p>

			<!-- (changed in Errata v3.0) -->
			<!-- <p>Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.</p>
			<p class="indent">Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow character.</p> -->
			<p>As a drow, you are infused with the magic of the Underdark, an underground realm of wonders and horrors rarely seen on the surface above. You are at home in shadows and, thanks to your innate magic, learn to conjure forth both light and darkness. Your kin tend to have stark white hair and grayish skin of many hues.</p>
			<p class="indent">The cult of the god Lolth, Queen of Spiders, has corrupted some of the oldest drow cities, especially in the worlds of Oerth and Toril. Eberron, Krynn, and other realms have escaped the cult’s influence—for now. Wherever the cult lurks, drow heroes stand on the front lines in the war against it, seeking to sunder Lolth’s web.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Superior Darkvision.</em></strong> Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sunlight Sensitivity.</em></strong> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Drow Magic.</em></strong> You know the dancing lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell, you must finish a long rest to cast the spell again with the trait. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell, you must finish a long rest to cast the spell again with the trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
