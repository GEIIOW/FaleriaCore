		<description>
			<p>Through many years of intense research, the greatest and most unethical arcane scholars managed to tap into a previously unkown source of magical power called Soul Power. Since then, they have founded a secret school to research the side effects of using soul power, but also to slowly build an army of Soul Gatherers.</p>

			<h4>BEACON OF THE DEAD</h4>
			<p>A soul gatherer can be quickly identified by their soul beacon. Every beacon is different, but they all share a glow coming from within it. They are the source of a gatherer’s power and with it a gatherer may collect soul power, cast spells and empower themselves or any allies that they manage to acquire.</p>
			<p>Many soul gatherers are loyal to the institution that trained them and are later sent on missions all around Faleria, while others defect and hide from their former teachers. What they do have in common is their secretive nature about their time spent in training.</p>

			<h4>EXPERIMENTAL WARRIORS</h4>
			<p>Soul gatherers are usually driven by either their desire to serve their superiors or the urge for personal growth, both compelling them to travel the world and empower themselves through souls. This desire to serve may blind these warriors to the true motivations of their teachers.</p>
			<p>Due to their recency, some gatherers are smistaken for simple warlocks, others have become the centre of scary stories to tell children and some others are subjugated to the role of mythical heroes. In general, they are feared but not hunted nor imprisioned on sight.</p>

			<h4>SOUL POWER</h4>
			<p>Every creature’s soul has power inside of it. Some souls are more powerful than others though, and these are gold mines for gatherers.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature only has usable soul power when it has 5 or more maximum hit points. Creatures, other than constructs and undead, have 1 soul power per 5 maximum hit points.</p>
			
			<h4>CREATING A FIGHTER</h4>
			<p>As you make your soul gatherer spend some time thinking about why they gather and spend soul power. Do they empower themselves to make mighty slashes with their longsword or do they hord it to be able to increase their own life? Think about the reason they joined the school as well as it is the whole reason they have their abilities.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some relevant questions to awnser about your character might be: Why did you join the school? What’s your beacon? Does your beacon have any connection to your past? Do you enjoy seeing the soul leave the body?</p>
			
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can quickly create a soul gatherer by following these suggestions. Firstly, choose Wisdom to be your highest ability score, followed by Strength. Secondly, choose the soldier background and grab a one-handed weapon, choose a beacon and some medium armor and you should be ready to go.</p>
		
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
			<p>As a Soul Gatherer, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per Soul Ghaterer level</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Soul Ghaterer level after 1st</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>PROFICIENCIES</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled mb">
                <li><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor</li>
                <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons</li>
                <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Calligrapher’s supplies</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom, Strength</li>
                <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Arcana, Athletics, History, Insight, Perception, Stealth or Survival</li>
            </ul>
			<h5>EQUIPMENT</h5>
			<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>(a)</i> leather armor or <i>(b)</i> chain shirt</li>
				<li><i>(a)</i> any simple weapon or <i>(b)</i> any martial weapon</li>
				<li><i>(a)</i> any simple weapon or <i>(b)</i> five javelins</li>
				<li>An explorer’s pack, caligrapher’s supplies and a soul beacon</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5>SOUL BOND</h5>
			<p>At level 1 you gain your first soul bond. A soul bond is a connection created by a soul gatherer and the world around them. As an action, the gatherer may bind themself to an ally, an enemy or to their beacon. To bind yourself to a creature with gatherable soul power you must use their cr or levels worth of soul power. There is no cost to bind yourself to an object, such as a beacon, nor to a creature with no harvestable soul power. Creating a soul bond with a creature reveals how much soul power they possess, but only lasts 1 minute.</p>
			<p>Bonds to creatures or objects can only be broken by the dispel magic or similar spells, by the death of the soul gatherer, by the death of the creature the bond is made with, via the destruction of the the bond was made with.</p>
			<p>You gain additional bonds at levels 3, 7, 10 and 15.</p>
