			<p>Old sons are the bottom of the barrel of silvanian society, seen as worse than slaves, they are fugitives or exiles who, if seen inside the empire, would have a good bounty on their head. Some old sons are thieves and murderers, others are natives of Issadrem or Gnawland who fought to escape the claws of the empire. Whatever may be the reason for their title, old sons are considered fugitives who have to be brought to justice and condemned.</p>
