			<ul>
				<li>Wolf’s Mark - Make a claw attack which will always be a critical on a hit, after this attack successfully hits you lose your stance.</li>
				<li>Hunter’s Takedown - The creature must make a Strength (Athletics) check against your Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Wisdom (Survival) check or go prone. After the creature fails you lose your stance.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can enter this stance a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
