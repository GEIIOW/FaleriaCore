			<p>When the partnership between Feldwin and Delfantis commenced the former left behind his family’s history in the continent of Zeiloryn to forge a new one in Manyhal. He successfully molded the Guild into what it is today and spent his life enriching his family’s coffers, setting up their place in the council for generations to come. Much like Delfantis’ death, the death of Feldwin Mallivan in 641 caused a week long mourning period in rememberance of one of the city’s great founders.</p>
			<p>As of today, House Mallivan is still the richest family in Elirium, being the first to found a village, named Cartokalia on the city’s outskirts. In the year 719 AP the family is made up of it’s head, the 28 year old Count Sendro Mallivan and his husband Lord Jamenon Mallivan. Count Sendro also has three sisters: Lady Sarilia, Lady Dandália and Lady Sianna Mallivan, all of them as cunning as they are elegant and married to underwhelming and petty men.</p>
